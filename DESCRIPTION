Description: Adapts HDP to mutational signature extraction. Calls hdpx for mutational signature analysis.mSigHdp 
             incorporates burnin and Gibbs sampling processes, followed up by extracting signatures from raw clusters 
             collected by Gibbs sampling, and improved diagnostic plotting with visualization on signature and exposures.
