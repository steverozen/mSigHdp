# mSigHdp

The goal of mSigHdp is to do mutational signature extraction using the hdpx package This branch of
mSigHdp depends on a branch of hdpx that was forked from Nicola Roberts's hdp package, and that
still implements the algorithm from
Section 4.2.2, "Extracting Consensus Signatures" from

Roberts, N. D. (2018). Patterns of somatic genome rearrangement in human cancer. (PhD Thesis). Cambridge University, Cambridge, England, United Kingdom. Retrieved from https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/275454/Roberts-2018-PhD.pdf

We do not recommend using this version.
