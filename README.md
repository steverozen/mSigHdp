# mSigHdp

The goal of mSigHdp is mutational signature discovery using 
hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) mixture models. mSigHdp
is only supported on Linux systems. Most users
will use the function RunHdpxParallel.

This package uses https://github.com/steverozen/hdpx for the
hierarchical Dirichlet process implementation.
